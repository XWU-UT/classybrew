##classybrew

**classybrew** uses the Jenks Natural Breaks Alrithm to generate classes based on intrinsic breaks in your data.  **classybrew** will also generate a range of **sequential** color codes based on the number of breaks in your data and a user defined palette.

This tool was built with help from two outstanding open source repositories.
